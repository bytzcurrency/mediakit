<h2>SLATE Description</h2>
<p>
  SLATE is a blockchain-based entertainment utility protocol powered by a
  cryptographically secure multilayered network. The decentralized system will
  deliver low-cost, high-speed, high-definition video globally and facilitate
  live event ticketing on the blockchain. Consumers will be able to spend SLATE
  cryptocurrency (SLX) on some of the best entertainment the world has to offer.
  The use of SLATE enables fair and transparent compensation between creators,
  producers, and distributors. Creators are compensated fairly and consumers get
  higher quality entertainment. Tickets purchased with SLATE will be forgery
  resistant, virtually eliminating fraud. Service providers holding SLX can earn
  even more by storing and delivering content.
